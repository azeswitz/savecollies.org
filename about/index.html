  <h1 class="page-heading">About CRI</h1>

Our love of collies has brought us together to focus on the breed we love the most! The rescue is comprised of many volunteers with diverse backgrounds such as collie enthusiasts, veterinarians, behaviorists, and collie club members. Our volunteers have been rescuing collies in Virginia and Maryland, as well as networking with collie rescues in nearby states since the beginning of 2005. Since its inception, Collie Rescue, Inc. has saved well over 275 collies from shelters and owners who no longer wanted their pets.

<h2>Mission</h2>
Collie Rescue, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization. Our mission is to place stray, abandoned and surrendered collies into loving and permanent homes, educate the public about the collie breed, and promote responsible pet care. Our goal is to provide a safe and healthy haven for all dogs placed in our care until loving, adoptive homes can be found.
<h2>Collie Care</h2>
Collies who find their way into our rescue are first examined by a veterinarian, vaccinated, heartworm tested, microchipped, and spay/neutered. All dogs are given the veterinary care needed to get to a healthy state. They are placed in foster homes where they are evaluated in order to find the best home for them. We provide heartworm medication and parasite prevention until they can be placed. Our foster homes provide food, lots of love and training!

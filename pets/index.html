    <h1 class="page-heading">Our Adoption Process</h1>

<p>Potential adopters complete a short adoption questionnaire. We check veterinary references, verify home ownership, and conduct a home visit with all families who adopt from us. We feel that getting to know our adopters results in a better placement for both the pet and the families! We provide as much information as we can on each petâ€™s history, disposition and health. </p>
    
    <p>After a placement, we follow up with each new adopter to offer assistance during the adjustment period. We want each of our animals to find the right home for them, not just any home. Likewise, we want our adopters to find the pet who best matches their lifestyle and interests. If for any reason the match is not perfect, as we had hoped, the dog must be returned to our organization.</p>
